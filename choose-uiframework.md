Selection of UI Framework for Project

## Status


Accepted

## Context


The issue that is motivating this decision is that we are understanding that the client wants to target a wide variety users and to make sure that target is met is simply by developing a app that is accessible to all users whether OS is IOS or Android. The client wants to target a wide range of users and the clients emphasizes that the UI needs to be user friendly.



## Decision
The change that will be implemented is to use React Native for UI Framework because it allows the development to be the done for IOS and Androids.


## Consequences

What becomes easier:

1. Cross-Platform Compatibility: User experience maintains a constant UI across devices.

2. Live Reload: The live reload function allows for developers to work on error fixes while the application is still in the loading process and will be replicated in the application.

3. UI Focused: The client has emphasized that the App needs to be easy to navigate and provide seamless ordering. React provides a developers to   develop highly interactive apps. There is rendering capabilities and uses a component-based approach which makes it easier to design more challenging UI interfaces.

4. Single line code: Develop components so that any code specific to a platform to a platform can be shared in just one codebase.

5. Components: Code is broken up into components. Components contain code specific to a certain section. Components can be reused/called at any time making it more efficient for developers when developing different app pages.
