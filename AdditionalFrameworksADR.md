# Title
Additional Frameworks and Stacks

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Some of these additional reasons for including more frameworks or stacks can include:

### Compatibility
Allowing the app to be used on many different platforms is important for development and use as users will want to be able to use the application from ay device. It also increases the customer base by quite a number as more people will have access to the application. This could mean developing for IOS and Android operating systems at the very least.

### Developer Productivity
This could include using more modern technology like React Native and Node.JS to allow developers to use the most up to date and popular tech stacks and frameworks. If developers are facing barriers based on what they are using currently, then it may be time to implement a more modern approach to the tech that you are using.


## Decision

### Adding Frameworks
This can be important as technology is always changing and being updated so you have to stay up to date. If need be, you can implement more frameworks or libraries to better include what is needed for the application to be successful. In more recent times we have seen an uprising in machine learning and AI tools, so it can be important to implement that somewhere into the app.

### Cross-Platform Enhancement
Being able to support multiple platforms is important to allowed for a wider range of users on many different devices. This may mean that you need to implement cross-platform development platforms such as Xamarin (allows usage oon Windows, IOS and Android) and also Flutter. All of these allow developers to code only one program but deploy it on multiple platforms.


## Consequences
There are easy implications and hard ones, we will start with the easy ones:

### Code Reusability
As stated before, allowing developers to develop on one platform which then expands outwards into more operating systems. This reduces duplication or code and takes less time to develop. It also can allow for more work to get done as the developers do not have to spend the additional time programming for all the operating systems that are planned.

### Faster Development
More can get done in less time when developers can develop on the same platform which spans out into other operating systems. It also offers more tools and libraries the make development nice and quick

A harder implication may include:

### Platform Specific UI/UX
While cross platform functionality is nice, it makes the user experience and interface hard to determine as not all operating systems run the same. Across different platforms also makes generalizing the user experience difficult as it may take more customization.
